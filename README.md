# forth-up
A Forth interpreter written in Python targeting CircuitPython and perhaps other Python environments.

Admittedly inefficient and a little insane, but is for fun until the wave of Forth aware programmers has a resurgence.
Until then, this project will stay in the back waters of language interpreters, land locked in an cove that only Python programmers that wish to explore being Forth programmers, that also use microprocessors, dwell.

But it gets worse, because this interpreter is not a standard Forth interpreter. Liberties have been taken with not implementing some things (of course you are welcome to add more features) and changing some central things about Forth.
Forth purists have left the site or at least they will after they glance at the list of changes and omissions.

Exploring the old Forth language with an eye to the modern trend toward functional programming has been the focus of this development. Forth has been called a procedural language, but is that really true? Here we can discuss its' interpretation. and extend it with pure functional features. So, to differentiate it from the classic Forth language, we call this interpreter 'Forth-Up.'
